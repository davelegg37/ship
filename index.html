Instructions For The USS Ship Of State

The goal of The USS Ship of State is to understand the dynamics of Presidential Decision Making.
To compare the President of the United States with the commander of  a ship is not unreasonable and provides us with a metaphor we can use to understand the complex business of being President of the United States.  This computer simulation puts you, the player,  in command of the submarine USS Ship Of State.  
As commander of this metaphoric submarine you will not only  command a submarine but,  through the metaphor,  you will  learn how the President commands the United States. How he chooses  goals i.e.  sets his agenda, selects the appropriate tools (options) to achieve the goals, acquires power, applies the power necessary to wield the tools.

You, as President, will also observe the results of your success or failure commanding the USS Ship of State  in terms of the rise and fall of your public approval rating and your reelection results.  As you read the following material keep in mind that,  although it appears that you are learning how to choose weapons and attack targets,  you are really learning how the President of the United States tries to exercise power to accomplish his goals.
For your information, the following is a list of terms in the USS Ship of State metaphor and the equivalent  term  relating to the United States Presidency:
USS Ship of State                             PresidencyCommander                                      PresidentWeapon                                             OptionTarget                                               Goal
-2-

Selecting Targets (Goals)The first screen you will encounter in the simulation is the Target (Goal)  Selection Sheet.  On this sheet you will find seven targets (goals).  You begin your presidential command by selecting  your own targets (goals).  This period is usually known  as the presidential honeymoon.  You will be allowed to choose the first two of the  four targets  (goals) you must accomplish.  Fate will then choose the last two; the honeymoon will be over.
Presidents  usually have to deal with many goals at the same time but even they tend to focus on one or two.  You, as Commander (President), will deal with only one target (goal) at a time.  As  Commander (President)  you will choose, or have chosen for you, from the Target (Goal) Selection Sheet one target (goal) and you will have to accomplish that target (goal) before you go on to the next one.  This allows you to focus your full attention on one target (goal) at a time but also means that you cannot duck an assigned  target (goal) when you fail to accomplish it by going on to other things.  Unlike a real president who can simply go overseas on a foreign trip when things get rough at home you are stuck and must finish what is begun.
Be careful in selecting your target (goal) as some are easier to accomplish then others.  Some of the goals require less power then others, some have a higher probability of accomplishment then others and some have both.  Try to choose the easiest goals to accomplish because fate may not be kind to you.
Selecting Weapons (Options)The next step in learning how to command the submarine USS Ship of State is to learn how to use the weapons system  because your weapons (options) are your primary tools for attacking your targets.

 Operating this weapon system is far more complex then firing a gun and involves the completion of a  number of steps before a weapon  can be launched  at a target.
Weapons represent the options available to a President  for use in  accomplishing his goals.   All weapon (options) are not the same.  Just as some weapons are more suited for one target than for another, some options are better suited to accomplish a certain goal then others and in both cases and some require much more power to exercise then others.   A good  Commander (President) chooses the most appropriate weapon (option) for the target (goal). The best weapon (option) is that with the highest probability of hitting the target (accomplishing the goal) at the least cost in power.  This choice is not always easy because those weapons (options) , which seem the most  capable of hitting the target (accomplishing the goal) are often very expensive in terms of power.
PowerThe next task is to choose how much power to expend in support of the weapon (option) you have chosen.   As President you have a variety of power sources available to you, represented in the metaphor by your four power fuel tanks labeled Legislative, Executive, Political and Public Relations.Legislative Power represents the power the President has  over the Legislature, The House of Representatives and the Senate, and its legislation.

Executive Power represents the power the President has  as commander in chief,  in foreign relations,  as head of state and as the chief executer of the law.

Political Power is the power that accrues to the President as the head of his party.
Public Relations power is the power to  organize,  mold and direct public opinion.
In applying power,  a Commander (President) wants to use enough power to exercise his option but not so much that he wastes power. The wise Commander (President) considers the nature of the option he has chosen and the nature of the power he has available and tries to choose the right amount of each type of power necessary to energize his weapon (option).
Acquiring power is very different from expending it, just as spending money is different from making it.  You can spend money very quickly but making it usually takes time and effort.  To acquire power you, as  Commander (President),  will have to demonstrate some of both time and energy  by successfully answering questions, which test your knowledge of the power in  each of the above power categories.  The more time and effort you invest in acquiring this knowledge the greater the probability of getting the right answers and thus more power.



-4-

ActionAfter considering your target (goal), selecting what you consider to be the most appropriate weapon (option), acquiring and expending the power necessary to energize the weapon (option),  you will launch your weapon at the target goal and observe the results.   Any time an action is initiated, whether it is a President trying to free hostages or a Submarine Commander trying to hit a target, the result is either a hit or a miss.   A hit is scored when you have. made wise weapon (option) choices,
. made judicious and correct expenditures of your power and have had some luck.  
Your target (goal) is missed if you have chosen weapons (options) with a low probability of success, have not invested enough power in your decision or the proper mix of that power,have had bad luck or probably all of the above.

There is more to scoring a hit, (being a successful Commander President) then power and skillful  weapon (option) choice.  Future success usually begins with a shrewd choice of target (goals).  Some targets (goals) are easy to accomplish, others are not.  Smart presidents, when given a choice,  will try to choose goals, which they can accomplish (easy targets) while avoiding those, which are difficult. Fate, however, does not always allow a president the luxury of choosing the goals he wishes to try and accomplish.  President Carter probably would not have chosen freeing the hostages held by Iran as a goal but fate didn't give him a choice.  As you try to become a successful Commander (President) you will have some control over the goals you have to accomplish  since you will be able to choose two of the four goals.  Choose carefully!
Approval RatingSuccessful Submarine Commanders (Presidents)  are those that accomplish their goals  while maintaining a high level of public approval.  They are the presidents who are reelected and popular.  Only history will judge whether presidents chose the proper goals or made the right decisions.  The use of the atomic bomb may have been successful but was it right?  The electorate at the time must have thought so since Truman was elected after he made the decision.  Supply side economics might have been an unwise goal but President Reagan became a very popular president trying to accomplish it.
-5-

To be reelected in this simulation you must accomplish four goals.  Not only do you wish to be reelected but you also wish to leave office as a popular president, as indicated in this simulation by a high approval rating.  Your approval rating and how well you accomplish your goals is measured by the number of misses you have while trying to accomplish your goals (the number of times you miss a target).  In the best of presidential worlds, a president accomplishes all of his goals with no failures.  There is never an Iran-Contra affair.
To The Control RoomNow that you have a general understanding of what it takes to be the  Commander of the submarine USS Ship of State it is time to introduce you to the actual operation of your ship.
The submarine that you  command  is a computer simulation.  You will command your computer submarine by choosing targets (goals)  and then choosing weapons (options) to accomplish those targets (goals). You will also have to acquire power and expend that power to energize your weapons (options).
After you have selected your first target (goal)you must use  the controls on this panel to.  choose  weapons (options),.  refill  power tanks (acquire power),  .  energize your weapon (option) with power,.  launch your weapon (option) and.  observe the results of your attack on the target-goal.
TOUR OF THE CONTROL PANEL
The Target Goal WindowThe target goal to be  accomplished is displayed in this window.  It is very important to carefully  consider your target goal in order to choose the weapon option, which will most likely  to hit  the target (accomplish your goal).  It also important to reevaluate your thinking after every miss.





The Weapon Option Window
This window displays for your choice the options available to you for accomplishing the target goal.  Click on the associated button to choose one of the options.
You may choose only one weapon option per weapon launch.  If the option you have chosen fails to accomplish your goal-hit the target,  you may choose another weapon option or use the same one over again.When choosing a weapon option consider both the goal you are trying to accomplish and the weapon option.  Consider:
.  What is the probability this option will accomplish the goal?  .  How much of each type of power will be needed to implement-energize, this weapon   option?.  Do I have enough power to use this weapon option?  .  What happened when I used this or a similar weapon option in the past?   
After you have made the above considerations,  choose a weapon option  by clicking the appropriate button.  A depressed button indicates that the particular weapons option has been chosen.  You cannot launch a weapon option until you have chosen one to launch.
Power GaugesThe Power Gauges on the Control Panel  show how much of each type power is available to implement a weapon option.  Both dial indicators and display windows indicate the amount.
Power LevelsUse  the slide controls to choose the amount of each type of power you wish to invest in the weapons option chosen.  Be very careful in this choice.  Consider the weapons options you have chosen and the type of power you are using to implement that option.  There is  a correlation between the two.  For example: You probably do not need as much Legislative Power as you do Executive Power to order the troops to take action while the opposite is


-7-

true to get a tax bill through Congress.  When you have decided on the amount,  click on the appropriate slide button and drag the button until the amount of power you wish to invest appears in the window below the slide control.
The Power Fill ButtonTo fill or refill your power tanks,  push the Power Fill Button.  Since you begin your presidential command with no power, one of your first tasks will be to acquire power, fill your power tanks.  You can also fill your tanks whenever you wish but in the event you run out of power you will be forced to refill your tanks before you can launch a weapon.
The  Power Menu will appear when the power fill button is clicked. From this menu choose which type of power you wish to acquire ( which power tank you wish to fill).  Power is acquired by demonstrating your knowledge and abilities by answering questions in categories pertaining to that type of power. After choosing a category  you will be given a number of questions to test your knowledge and skill in this category. Power Units will be given for every correct answer.  Once you have answered a question correctly it will not  appear again.You can switch power categories, choose to fill other power tanks (acquire other types of power), or return to the Control Panel by clicking the appropriate button.
The Activate Power ButtonClicking this button energizes your weapon option with the amount of each type power you have selected.  A weapon option cannot be launched without first energizing it by clicking the  Activate Power Button.
The Fire ButtonAs the name implies, clicking this button will launch your weapon option.  Before launching your weapon you must have:.  selected a weapon option to launch,.  selected the amount of each type of power with which you wish to energize that weapon   option,.  energized your option by clicking the Power Activate Button.


-8-

When you have completed all the steps your weapon is ready to launch. You can be reminded of these steps at any time by going over your check list.
You are  ready to launch your weapon option.  Do this by clicking the Fire button. Observe the results of your launch from the observation deck.  The weapon option speeds towards  its target goal either hitting or missing the target.
Result IndicatorThe results of your launch are reported  on two indicators.  The Results Window provides feedback on the launch you have just made.  There are three possible outcomes each time you launch a weapons option.
1. You may not have invested enough power to implement your option, your weapon didn't have enough power to reach its target.  If your power investment was correct you will notified and cna assume you just had bad luck.  In this case it may  not be unreasonable  to choose that option again and launch it with more power.
2. Your weapon may have had enough power but missed its target goal. This could occur because your weapons option had a low probability of accomplishing the goal, bad luck or a combination of both.  Both of these should be taken into consideration when deciding on reusing this weapons option.
3. You may have done everything right and scored a hit, accomplished your goal.  In this case you will be returned to the target goal selection list to choose another goal.  If you have already chosen two goals fate will choose your next two.
The second indicator, the Approval Rating Indicator shows the effect of your latest launch on you overall approval rating.  A miss, failure to accomplish your goal,  lowers your approval rating while successful accomplishment of a goal raises your rating.
